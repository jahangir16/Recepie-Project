           <li> ⅘ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            
           <li> ½ tablespoon and ½ teaspoon water</li>
            
           <li> ⅔ (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            
           <li> ⅔ cup plain yogurt</li>
            
           <li> ½ tablespoon and ½ teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            
           <li> ⅘ teaspoon salt</li>
            
           <li> ¼ cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoons water</li>
            
           <li> ⅘ teaspoon garam masala</li>
            
           <li> ½ tablespoon and ½ teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            
           <li> ½ tablespoon and ½ teaspoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>  <u>  Directions:  </u> </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>  
        Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt. </li>
        
        <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches 
        until completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.</li>
        
      <li> 
        Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet.
         Cook and stir until onion turns soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, 
         turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat 
         together for about 1 minute while stirring. Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro,
          and 1 teaspoon salt to the mixture; stir to combine.</li>
        
       <li> 
        Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate.
         Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. 
         Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.</li>
        
      <li>  
        Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center
         and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into 
         the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drizzle with lemon juice to 
         serve.</li>
